                    <span>
                        <span class="blueWord">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated
                        students
                        as part of their web
                        development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.

                        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and
                        maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="blueWord">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage
                        their
                        tasks and projects in an
                        intuitive, visual interface.

                        It is important to note that <span class="blueWord">Join</span> is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for
                        extensive business usage.

                            When you log in to <span class="blueWord">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project and
                            contains four default lists:
                            "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".

                            <div class="subHeadlineHelp">Creating Contacts</div>
                            In <span class="blueWord">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section,
                            click on "New contact", and
                            fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on
                            the board.

                            Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button
                            under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due
                            date, assignees, etc.

                            As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one
                            list to another.

                            Once as a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete ir. Deleting a card will permanantly
                            remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting card, as this action is irreversible.<br><br>Remember that
